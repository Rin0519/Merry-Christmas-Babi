        <p>Hey lover,
              How's my pretty girl doing, hm? I'm currently missing you right now. 
              To be honest, I'd never expect someone like you to enter my life. Even now im quite astonished that I can proudly call you mine.
              God really does listen beacuse baby you're my payers, personified. Thank God.
              You're the best gift I've received this year, Chareece.
              
        </p>
        <p>I love you always, and in all ways. - Yesha</p>
